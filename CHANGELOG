# Version 0.2.0 - 2016.12.27

This version removes the HTTP proxy piece about torotator and simply load
balances and rotates SOCKS5 proxies directly. Privoxy has been removed.

If an HTTP proxy is required, it's far easier to create one instance of privoxy
or whatever proxy you prefer in front of the load balanced, rotating SOCKS5
proxies provided by torotator.
